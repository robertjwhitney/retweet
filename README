Easy Retweet Button

Jeresig's Retweet Button is great, but I felt that it was missing some simple attention to detail regarding UI patterns. I feel that using the twitter blues, and a small "t" logo, instead of the green with the recycling icon, make the purpose of the button immediately recognizable to the user, thereby producing fewer unexpected results.
